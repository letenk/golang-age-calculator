# Golang Age Calculator
Code to calculate age based on year, month, day and time.

The source code was obtained from a thread on StackOverflow. You can see it on this link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36530251/time-since-with-months-and-years)

Here I made modifications so that it can support a different number of days in each month. Handles cases such as February in leap years or months with 28, 30 and also 31 days.
